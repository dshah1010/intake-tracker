# Inspiration 
As an individual who goes to the gym on a daily basis, I like to track the foods and beverages I eat and drink, including the amount of calories, carbs, protein, and fat. Additionally, if I forget the recipe, the option to write ingredients helps out. 

# Technology 
This web application uses HTML and Bootstrap for the styling portion, and JSON with JavaScript to keep track of adding and deleting recipes. It also saves the recipes in your local storage, so until you don't delete your recipes, they'll always be there (doesn't matter if you refresh or close your tab).

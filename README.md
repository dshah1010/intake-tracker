# intake-tracker
Working out is great but tracking your consumptions is the hardest part for me, so I created a web application that will allow you to store the food/beverages you eat/drink in a day. You can include its ingredients, calories, carbs, protein, fat, and any notes. 

Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JSON
